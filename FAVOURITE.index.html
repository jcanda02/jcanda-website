    <h1>My Favorites</h1>
    
    <h2>Movies</h2>
    <p>Movies are my escape! I love getting lost in different worlds and stories, and I'm always up for a good laugh or a tearjerker. Some of my all-time favorites include the hilarious and irreverent "Deadpool," the epic romance of "Titanic," and the breathtaking fantasy of "The Lord of the Rings." These movies have stayed with me long after the credits rolled, and they always remind me of the power of storytelling.</p>
    
    <h2>Anime</h2>
    <p>Anime is my gateway to vibrant worlds and unforgettable characters. I love the way it blends action, humor, and heart, often exploring themes that resonate deeply with me. Some of my favorites include the action-packed adventures of "Fairy Tail" and "Hunter x Hunter," the heartwarming romance of "Horimiya," and countless others. Anime always keeps me entertained and inspired.</p>
    
    <h2>Online Gaming</h2>
    <p>Online gaming is my way to connect with others and challenge myself. I love the competitive spirit of games like Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB), but I also enjoy the strategic thinking and decision-making in more text-based games. It's a great way to unwind, have fun, and test my skills.</p>
    
    <h2>Korean Drama</h2>
    <p>K-dramas are my guilty pleasure! I love the way they blend romance, drama, and humor, often with captivating storylines and relatable characters. Some of my favorites include the historical romance of "Scarlet Heart," the fantasy adventure of "Goblin," and the thrilling social commentary of "Squid Game." K-dramas always keep me entertained and engaged.</p>
    
    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>Music is the soundtrack of my life, each song telling a story that resonates with my experiences and emotions. Among my favorites are "Padaba Taka," a soulful melody that speaks to the depths of my soul; "Count on Me," a heartwarming tune that reminds me of the bonds of friendship and support; and "Reflection," a powerful ballad that mirrors my journey of self-discovery and growth.</p>
    
    <h2>Hanging Out with Friends</h2>
    <p>Nothing beats hanging out with my friends! We love catching up, sharing stories, and enjoying good food and drinks. Whether it's a casual dinner, a night out at a bar, or just a lazy afternoon at someone's place, these moments are always filled with laughter and good times. My friends are my rock, and I cherish the time we spend together.</p>
