    <h1>Autobiography</h1>
    <p>My name is Justin Mae R. Canda. I was born on December 02, 2003, in Pasay City, Philippines. At the age of 20, I've already experienced a lot. From the excitement of growing up in the city to the challenges of starting a new life in a different environment, I've learned a lot about myself and the world around me. These experiences have shaped my values, my aspirations, and my desire to make a positive impact.</p>
    
    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>I was born in the vibrant city of Pasay, where I spent my early years. We later moved to Makati City, but unfortunately, our home there was destroyed in a fire. This led us to relocate to South Ville 8B, Barangay San Isidro, Rodriguez, Rizal. While I miss the energy of city life, I've embraced the quieter pace and the beauty of nature in Rizal.</p>
    
    <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I find joy in the simplest things, like hanging out with friends, getting lost in the world of K-dramas, creating TikToks, and watching my favorite MSA videos. These moments bring a sense of fun and connection to my life. I also have a deep love for spoken poetry, finding its raw emotion and powerful delivery incredibly captivating.</p>
    
    <h2>Education and Career</h2>
    <p>I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in English Language Studies (ABELS). The study of language has always fascinated me, and I'm eager to explore its various facets, from literature and linguistics to communication and cultural studies. My passion lies in teaching English, specifically TEYL (Teaching English for Young Learners). I believe that introducing children to the world of language at an early age can foster a love of learning and open doors to new opportunities.</p>
    
    <h2>Dreams and Aspirations</h2>
    <p>My dreams don't stop at the classroom. I also envision myself as a writer, creating my own MSA stories and bringing them to life. The challenge of crafting compelling narratives and exploring new worlds through writing excites me. I also hope to explore spoken poetry further, perhaps even performing my own work someday.</p>
    
    <h2>Travel and Language</h2>
    <p>I believe that travel is an essential part of personal growth and development. I want to explore the world, immerse myself in different cultures, and continue developing my skills as a writer and communicator. Each new experience will enrich my perspective and fuel my creativity. I'm also passionate about learning new languages. I believe that being multilingual opens doors to new cultures, perspectives, and opportunities.</p>
